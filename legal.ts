Welcome to V-Ken Serve! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the V-Ken Serve platform ("Platform") to find and book services from independent third-party service providers ("Service Providers").

**1. The V-Ken Serve Platform**

V-Ken Serve is a technology platform that connects users seeking home, corporate, and tour services with independent Service Providers.

**IMPORTANT: V-KEN SERVE IS SOLELY A VENUE FOR CONNECTING USERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ARE NOT AN EMPLOYER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND ARE NOT AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES OF V-KEN SERVE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE QUALITY, SAFETY, OR LEGALITY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED.**

**2. User Accounts & Responsibilities**

- You must be at least 18 years old to create an account.
- You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information during registration.
- You are responsible for your interactions with Service Providers. We recommend exercising caution and common sense.

**3. Booking, Quotations, and Payments**

- **Booking Fee:** To secure an appointment with a Service Provider, you will be charged a non-refundable booking fee through the Platform. This fee confirms your slot with the provider.

- **Service Types:** You can book services either through "Instant Booking" at a provider's set hourly rate or by "Requesting a Quote" for custom jobs.

- **Quotations:** For quote-based jobs, the Service Provider will send you a detailed quotation through the Platform. You must review and accept this quotation before the service can be confirmed and started. The accepted quote forms the basis of the final invoice.

- **Final Payment:** Upon completion of the service, the Service Provider will mark the job as complete, and an invoice will be generated within the app based on the agreed-upon amount (either from the accepted quote or calculated based on hours for instant bookings). All final payments for services must be made through the V-Ken Serve Platform's secure payment system.

- **Payment Facilitation:** V-Ken Serve acts as a payment facilitator. While we process transactions, we are not a party to the financial agreement between you and the Service Provider and are not liable for payment disputes.

**4. Cancellations**

- The booking fee is non-refundable.
- If you need to cancel or reschedule, please do so at least 24 hours in advance by contacting the provider directly through the platform's chat feature. Failure to do so may result in additional charges from the provider.

**5. Limitation of Liability**

V-Ken Serve is not liable for any damages, including but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, or financial loss arising from the services rendered by a Service Provider. Any claims must be directed to the Service Provider.

**6. Termination**

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms.

By using V-Ken Serve, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.

- **Quotations & Invoicing:** For custom jobs, you are required to create and send a quotation to the Customer through the Platform. Once the job is completed, you must mark it as complete in the app, which will generate a final invoice for the Customer based on the accepted quotation or agreed-upon rate.

- **Service Payment:** All payments from the Customer for the final service value are processed securely through the V-Ken Serve Platform.

    - For jobs with a Total Job Value **greater than KES 2,500**, a commission of **10%** is applied *only* to the amount exceeding KES 2,500.
    
    *Example: If a job's total value is KES 5,000, the commission payable to V-Ken Serve is 10% of (KES 5,000 - KES 2,500), which equals KES 250.*

- **Deductions:** Commission fees and any other applicable charges will be automatically deducted from the Customer's payment before the net amount is disbursed to you.
